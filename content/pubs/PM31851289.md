Here we present a browser based Semi-Automated Metabolic Map Illustrator (SAMMI) for the visualization of metabolic networks. While automated features allow for easy network partitioning, navigation, and node positioning, SAMMI also offers a wide array of manual map editing features. This combination allows for fast, context specific visualization of metabolic networks as well as the development of standardized, large-scale, visually appealing maps. The implementation of SAMMI with popular constraint-based modeling toolboxes also allows for effortless visualization of simulation results of genome-scale metabolic models. SAMMI has been implemented as a standalone web-based tool and as plug-ins for the COBRA and COBRApy toolboxes. SAMMI and its COBRA plugins are available under the GPL 3.0 license and are available along with documentation, tutorials, and source code at www.SammiTool.com.
