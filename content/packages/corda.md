CORDA, short for Cost Optimization Reaction Dependency Assessment is a method
for the reconstruction of metabolic networks from a given reference model (a
database of all known reactions) and a confidence mapping for reactions
developed by A. Schultz and A. Qutub. It allows you to quickly reconstruct
metabolic models for tissues, patients or specific experimental conditions from
a set of transcription or proteome measurements.
