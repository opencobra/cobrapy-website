DD-DeCaF is a Horizon 2020 project (grant agreement No 686070)
bringing together leading academic partners from five European
universities with five innovative European companies to address the
challenge of building a comprehensive design tool. **DD-DeCaF** aims
to develop cutting edge methods in order to use large scale data to design
cell factories and communities for biotechnological applications. The
project is built as a number of micro-services which can be used
separately and via the [web-based user-interface](https://app.dd-decaf.eu/).
