SAMMI is an interactive tool for the visualization of constraint-based 
models. While automated features allow for easy network partitioning, 
navigation, and node positioning, SAMMI also offers a wide array of manual 
map editing features. This combination allows for fast, context-specific 
visualization of metabolic networks as well as the development of 
standardized, large-scale, visually appealing maps.
