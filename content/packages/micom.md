micom is a Python package for metabolic modeling of microbial communities.

micom allows you to construct a community model from a list on input COBRA
models and manages exchange fluxes between individuals and individuals with the
environment. It explicitly accounts for different abundances of individuals in
the community and can thus incorporate data from 16S rRNA sequencing
experiments.
