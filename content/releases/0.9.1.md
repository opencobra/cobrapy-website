# Release notes for cobrapy 0.9.1

## Fixes

* All around improvements to cobrapy's continuous integration.
* Pin the scipy version to 0.19.1 until we can upgrade our sparse matrix code to
  scipy 1.0.

## New features
<!--more-->

* Compatibility with symengine. Symengine can now power optlang and thus make
  many simulation tasks faster. Please try it out!
  It's as simple as `pip install symengine`.
* When writing to JSON or YAML metabolites, reactions, and genes by default
  maintain the order of the model. Their annotations are alphabetically sorted.
* Duplicate reactions are now properly ignored. They were causing `ValueError`s
  before.
* Automatic GitHub releases upon tagged releases.
* Automatic deployment of website upon tagged releases.
